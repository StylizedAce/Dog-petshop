# Dog-petshop

Firstly, sorry it took me so long to make this application - I had gotten busy with work recently and finally got some time off to make this application. I can feel i have gotten a little rusty, but i warm up quickly so that wouldnt be a problem for more than a day 


# How to start

* Just run: 
``` python client.py ```
    * I have made it so the app.py is automatically run by client.py so its easier to start up.


### Your description:

 a Flask app, to set up a dog shop with gems. So I need to have some breeds, names and prices so if you enter the shop you can buy a pet :)


# Features

- Shop where you can buy a dog using gems for currency
- Dogs have names, prices and breeds
- Simple application with no frontend
- Flask application in the console


# Extra ideas

I decided to keep it simple as you asked me to, but i could expand upon the application with code optimization like:
    
* Replacing the current filewrite system with something more efficient 
    * Using a filewrite system that does not truncate the files as they're opened
* Optimizing the API-calls
    * Removing extra steps i included to show understanding

## Features i wanted to do but decided to leave out

As mentioned i dont want to overdo it, so i exluded:
* Admin-page (in the console) to where you can add or remove dogs/users
    * But that would cause the code to get complex with conditions
* Giving more options like being able to inspect a particular dog and read about it and its background
